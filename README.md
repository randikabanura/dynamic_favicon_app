# Dynamic Favicon App

Do you want to dynamically change the favicons in a Rails application?

Here is how to do it. In a new tech article in Medium, I discuss ways to achieve this. One of which is Page wise favicons where you can use a Ruby module (Rails helper) to achieve that. Another one is action-based and event-based favicon changes that you can do using Stimulus. Both of these approaches are thoroughly discussed in the article.
